Loops in Java are the blocks set by you to repeat something over and over. imagine that you want to perform short
operation by repeating something, that is why we have a different types of loops because they serve different purposes
for you. Lets list all known loops:
- while loop (some can be do while loops)
- for loop (some can be for each loops, but it can be also used for decrementing and incrementing)
- nested loops (basically loops inside of loops)
- infinite loops (loops that repeat themselves endlessly until you stop them)
Loops save time, avoid excessive code lines and keep your code readable. 

1. for loop (increment and decrement):
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
}
for example this snippet, here we insert 'i' first and set it to zero, then we choose condition and then we increment 'i'.
Basically we are saying: "int i equals to zero, if i is less then 5, then increment i).
2. for each loop (commonly looping trough the arrays):
for(int i : numbers) {
}
what we did here is that we kind of asked 'i' to run over 'numbers' array and collect along with it. 
Think of saying: "I will loop them at once but get all the values"
3. Nested loops (those can be any kinds of loops inside of loops):
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
     for(int i2 = 0; i2 < i; i++) {
    }
}
Little difference with nested loops is that you can access incremented variable from first loop to second and you can perform
multiple looping at the same time, there can be as much nesting as you wish.
4. infinite loops(much simpler):
because those are loops that will never stop unless you manually stop them:
for(;;) {
   //anything goes here.
}
or:
while(true) {
  //anything goes here
}
both of them are simpler then increment/decrement for loops and for each loops or do while loops but not 
super commonly used. 
5. Do-while loop:
do {
// code goes here
}while(x == 5){
}
it makes sense from multiple glances, because its about doing something while condition is happening. like if x equals to five 
then something can be performed.
