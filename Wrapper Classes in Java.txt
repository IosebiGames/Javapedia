Wrapper classes in Java basically are Reference datatypes and similar to primitive datatype variables but their function and way
of how you declare it differs from classic primitive variables. Wrapper classes provide additional functions that can help to work
with Primitive variables, such as by Wrapping them. of course Wrapper Classes's constructors itself got depricated starting
from Java 9 but Wrapper classes by itself are still totally functional as they were. Why did this happen? Well because now 
Reference datatype variables already have their own in-built helpful functions like:
String.valueOf() or Integer.valueOf() or Boolean.valueOf()
But generally using Wrapper classes is not hard, Here is how you declare them for usage:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
          Integer n = new Integer(5);
          String t = new String("Hello");
          Boolean b = new Boolean(true);
          Character ch = new Character('A');
          Byte by = new Byte(8);
          Long l = new Long(1000000000L);
          Short sh = new Short(10);
          Float f = new Float(2.76f);
          Double d = new Double(2.75);
   }
}
However some people may combine Wrapper classes with Autoboxing and Unboxing.
