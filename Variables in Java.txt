Variables in Java are containers that help you to store different values. 
Some people consider variables as placeholders but during programming, variables are very important because sometimes
you need to store text, characters, numbers and more. And because of how everyone needs variables for a different goals,
we have a two datatypes of variables, Primitive and Reference. to understand it easily, ask yourself:
Primitive -> Do I want to store actual value of the variable in the memory?
Reference -> Or..am I planning to refer to address where value of variable is stored?
So basically, Primitive is for storing actual value of the variable in the memory when Reference datatype is used to not store
but point where is varible's value located in the memory.
Exmaple:
int - is used to store numbers, but not extreamly long ones.
String - used to store texts, but not characters. (String is already Reference datatype)
byte - used to store bytes, but not above then number of 127.
short - used to store short numbers.
long - used to store extreamly long numbers, but at the end must end with Capital L.
double - used to store double numbers (like 2.75)
boolean - can either store value of 'true' or 'false'
float - can store numbers similarly to double but at end must be ended with Lowercase f. (like 2.76f)
char - can store only letters (characters), but not the actual words (like 'A')
Simple way to declare variables:
public class Main {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
	     int x = 5;
	     String name = "Bob";
	     double d = 2.75;
	     long longNumber = 123000000000000L;
	     short shortNumber = 22;
	     boolean ThisIsTruth = true;
	     byte b = 127;
	     float fVariable = 2.76f;
	     char ch = 'A';
      }
}
However starting from the latest Java version (like Java 24), they have added 'var' keyword to reduce those 'strongly-typed'
feelings for people who hate it. basicallly you can write:
var myVar = "Hello";
Even if I did not specify to the compiler that I am using String, it still 'understood' that I am using a String.
And yes, variables can be either local or global/member.
