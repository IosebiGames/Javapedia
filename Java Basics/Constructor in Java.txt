Constructor in Java is very 𝐬𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐚𝐫 to method even if it is not a method in classic sense. it is kind of block that has only 
visibility modifiers and class name and body. but not a return types. constructor gets 𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐝 when you create new instance
of the class where constructor is being declared. Constructor gets called whether its created or not. 

example of Constructor:
public class Main2 {
    // you can make constructor public, private, protected or 𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐞 visibility modifer from constructor at all.
     public Main2() {
      System.out.println("Hello");     
    }
}
public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
              Main2 m2 = new Main2(); // will print 'Hello' because constructor is called.
     }
}
