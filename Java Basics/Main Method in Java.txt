main method in Java (also sometimes called PSVM) is a main entry point of your Java program/application. whenever you
want to run your Java code in Java SE (Standard Edition). Whenever you want to execute your Java code, you need to have
main method. There are many ways of how you declare it but classic way to do it is:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
              System.out.println("Hello");
      }
}
many people get confused because of main method's  keywords but actually its easy to understand how it works:
'public' keyword is present there because main method needs to be accessed by JVM in it's different regions way outside
of class where PSVM is declared. so basically its public because it needs to be accessed outside of class where its declared.
'static' can be confusing as well but actually when method, instance, variable is static, it becomes part of the method, JVM
won't have to create new and new instances of same class to just access main method in a class where its declared. 
'void' means that main method is type of method which does not return anything or it has no any return type. 'main' is just
a name for main method. 'String[]args' are the program arguments that come from your IDE or Development environment.
It can be helpful to store arguments there but it is optional and not always neccessery.
main method should be declared inside of class and not inside of any method or constructor:
public class Main {//opening
    //here
}//closing

many would ask how does it work, well..when you run your Java code that has a main method, java.exe gets invoked which
accesses your native system's LoadLibrary which can run the implementation of JVM, Hotspot.
