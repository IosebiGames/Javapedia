Loops in Java are blocks of code that help you to repeat code over and over. they help to make your code more efficient and
clean. They are very commonly used and helpful. there are many types of loops depending on what are you trying to do.
in Java we have:
- while loop (repeat something over and over always if condition allows it)
- do-while loop (repeat something once but only continue to repeat if condition allows it. If condition doesn't then it stops)
- for loop (used to increment/decrement values)
- for-each loop (used to loop trough the arrays or components at once to get all contents of it. its pretty short)
- Nested loops (loops inside of loops. for example while loop inside of while loop or for loop inside of for loop.)
- Infinite loops (it always continues to repeat over and over unlness you stop it manually by yourself.)
Examples:
1. while Loop :
    while(x == 5) {
       // do something
}
2. do-while loop:
    do {
        //code goes here.
    }while(x == 5);
3. for loop:
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       //code goes here. 'i' gets incremented from 0 to 5    
}
4. for-each loop:
    for(String name : names) {
         //code 
   } 
5. Nested loops:
    for(int i =0; i < 5; i++) {
       for(int i2 = 0; i2 < 4; i2++){
            //code
     }
   }
6. Infinite loops:
   while(true) {
      //repeat something infinitely but use 'return' keyword to stop the loop manually from inside.
}
   for(;;) {
      // pretty similar to infinite while loop, code goes here.
  }
