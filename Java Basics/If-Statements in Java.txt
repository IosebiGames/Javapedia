in Java we have If-statements to check condition and then do something once, unlike do-while loop or infinite loops where
condition is being checked and code is repeated, If-statements are block of code that check something only once.
They can check conditions, if variables equal to something, and if conditions align, something specific can happen.

by default, if statements work like this:

public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
          int x = 5;
          int y = 2;
          int z = x + y;

          if(z > 0){
               System.out.println(z);
          }
   }
}
Here we check if 'z' is more than zero, and if yes then we print out value of 'z'
If statements can work for boolean values, and many many things that have any value. 
You can even check if object is not null:

public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
             myClass mc = new MyClass(); 
             
             if(mc != null) {
                  //code goes here.
            }
     }
}
If statements can be used everywhere assuming you are doing it inside of field, method, constructor but makes sure it 
is not being used in loops or repetetive blocks but even if it is, keep it under control.
