methods in Java are parametrized fields that can be called to perform some actions, think of them as functions that
you can use anytime when you need to perform some action, methods can come with OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
Principles such as method overriding/Overloading. methods can have their own return type or they can be normal methods 
that do not return anything. methods should be declared inside of class but they can't be declared inside of method, field,
constructor itself, it should be declared seperately. methods can also be called from another classes. 
let take a look at basic method:
public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
             perform();
      }
      public static void perform() {
          System.out.println("Hello");
       }
 }
as you can see, running the code will result console window printing 'Hello'. just like classes, methods have their own opening
and closing body. methods can contain if statements, switches and more. but there is another way to call non-static method
in a static context:
public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
          new Main().create();
     }
     public void create() {
     }
}
like this, But methods can be overloaded as we said. when you do method overloading, You can use those paramaters
from method but later you need to pass arguments when you call that method:
public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
           create("Bob", 25);        
     }
     public static void create(String name, int age) {
            System.out.println(name);
            System.out.println("" + age);
    }  
}
it will work but you can do it  even in non-static context:
public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           new Main().create("Bob", 25); 
   }
   public void create(String name, int age) {
          System.out.println(name);
          System.out.println("" + age);      
   }  
}
it will work, But as we said methods can be overrided or called from another class. to call it from another class, you need to
create another class with method first, then instantiate it and call method from instance of that new class:
public class newClass {
     public void create() {
      }
} 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
          newClass nc = new newClass();

         nc.create(); 
   }
}
or lets do a method overriding:
public class newClass {
          public void create() {}
}
public class Main extends newClass {
      public static void main(String[] args) {

     }
     public void create() {
		
     }
}
that is how you override, overload methods and use them in Java but sometimes you can use it for encapsulation too:
public class newClass {
      private String name;
      private int age;
      private double weight;
	
         private String getName() {
             return name = "Bob";
         }
         private int getAge() {
              return age = 25;
         } 
         private double getWeight() {
              return weight = 60.0;
      }
}
