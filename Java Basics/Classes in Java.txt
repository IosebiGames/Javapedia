Classes in Java are group of code. whenever you want to write a java code, you must use or create any class where code
should go. Those classes can be used inside of other classes if you create instance of it. you can call methods or access
other variables/Objects from the instance of class that you have created. usually classes come with .java file extension at the 
end, for example: Main.java, myClass.java and so on.

Typical structure of class:
public class Main {
   // code goes here
}
if class is created inside of package, then it needs package declaration above:
package myPackage;
public class Main {
        // code goes here
}
file format of class did not change much because it mostly stays the same, However on December 11 of 2006, class file format
was modified little bit under JSP 202 (Java Specification Request).
