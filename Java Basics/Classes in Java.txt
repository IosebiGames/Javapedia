Usually whenever we want to write a Java code, we need to create a new class or use already existing one.
classes are group of code that you write, usually they end with .java files. (ex: Main.java, Game.java, myClass.java)
classes have their declaration syntax too:
public class Main { //opening
      //rest of the code goes here 
}//closing
