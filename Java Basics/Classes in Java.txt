Usually whenever we want to write a Java code, we need to create a new class or use already existing one.
classes are group of code that you write, usually they end with .java files. (ex: Main.java, Game.java, myClass.java)
classes have their declaration syntax too:
public class Main { //opening
      //rest of the code goes here 

}//closing

Also importantly when we want to use one class in another, we need to create a new instance of that class:
public class Main {
    int x = 5;
}
public class Main2 {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main m = new Main(); 
    }
}
'm' now is a instance name, you can use 'Main' class inside of Main2 class.
