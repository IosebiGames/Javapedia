to make a most basic program in Java to test how it works and how does it run, you can print out 'Hello' in the
console window. we have learned a main method where code goes and we have already learned syntax of the class.
Many kinds of things can be done in main method but we can do now is that we can do something as specific and printing
out a message:
public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
           System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}
