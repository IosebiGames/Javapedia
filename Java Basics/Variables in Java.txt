in Java we have a variables, those are containers to store values and data. There are two types of variables,
Primitive and Reference datatypes. variables have a different types for different context because they let you store texts, numbers, characters and more.
variables that we have in Java are: 
- int (stores the numbers, but not extreamly long ones)
- String (already reference datatype, but stores texts)
- boolean (stores values that can either be true or false only)
- char (stores characters and letters)
- float (can store float numbers but usually ends with lowerCase 'f' at the end.)
- double (stores the double values, similar to how float does it)
- long (can store very long numbers but it similarly ends with 'L')
- short (can store a short numbers)
- byte (can store byte numbers but not above 127)
Those variables should go inside of class, but variables need to have their own unique names too:
int x = 5;
String name = "Bob";
boolean v = true;
char letter = 'A';
and so on.
