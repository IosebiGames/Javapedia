Before writing a Java code, we have to download JDK (Java Development Kit) from Oracle, the JDK contains JRE.
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment which provides Java Virtual Machine (JVM) exactly that Virtual machine which
helps to make Java programs/codes platform-independent and runnable by interpreting bytecode.

After downloading JDK, we setup Java Home by copying JDK path from our program files and pasting it in System variables
in 'Edit System environment variables'. they are very important for command-prompt Java operations. It can partially interfere
with Java development too.

and the IDE (Integreted Development Environment) is a Tool which lets us debug, read, run and modify our code safely.
many IDEs let you pick JRE version of the Project.
