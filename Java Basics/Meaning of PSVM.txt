we all know that in Java, main method looks like this:
public static void main(String[] args) {
}
but many of you ask, why public static void main and not anything else. why does it even matter?
Well you see, when you execute your Java code, Hotspot JVM loads native libraries trough the LoadLibrary and
JVM (Java Virtual Machine), JIT (Just in Time) Compiler and Hotspot start working on it to execute your Java code.

but before running your Java code, it must use main method for command line arguments (optional), or use
main method for important processes. so Correctly declared main method matters.

public - as you understand, means that main method can be accessed in other classes.
static - means that main method can be used by JVM without needing to create new instance of class where PSVM is being declared.
void - means, it specifies that it is just a default method.
main - name for Main method.
(String[] args) - 'args' array has contents of Program Arguments and VM argumets.

its important to declare main method correctly as it is originally, you can say static public void main but still, PSVM is more 
recognizable.
