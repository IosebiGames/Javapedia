Packages in Java can help you to seperate classes and files from each other, instead of dragging and dropping resources in just
one package or instead of creating all classes in one package, you can create multiple ones and seperate them.
Packages are very similar to folders in your project structure (But in Eclipse folders and packages act really similarly when
they are created in project structure).

But most important part here is:
Class that is inside of specific package needs to have package declaration on top, usually with 'package' keyword.
'package' keyword is declared at very top and mainly specifies that Class is under specific package.
Usually when you create new Class under some package, IDE automatically generates that package declaration.
However, sometimes you have to add it manually.

Example of how it looks:

package myPackage;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
     }
}
Or if you want to use other classes from another packages, you need to add import declarations in order to use those classes:

import myPackage.MyObject;
public class Main {
     MyObject mo;
     public void create(){
        mo = new MyObject();
    }
}
and that is something that you have to do manually.
Interesting fact: In eclipse, you can automatically import by combination of 'Ctrl' + 'Shift' + 'O' Keys.
