short instance creating in Java is when you create new instance of class/Object 𝐚𝐭 𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞 while calling constructor 
of the class at the same time. it can be often done if you want to create new instance of the class without needing to
use it later. it can be pretty short and effective depending on goal.

example:
public class Main2 {
     public Main2() {
         System.out.println("Hello");     
    }
}
public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
              new Main2(); // will print 'Hello' because constructor is called and new instance of the class is created at once.
     }
}
