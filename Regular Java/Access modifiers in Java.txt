in Java, we can declare variables, objects, methods, fields without needing to apply any access modifier to it. usually 
variable/Object/field/method can work if declared correctly in class itself where it is created...But if you want to access it from 
another class, it would get problematic because it has no access modifiers.
 that's why we regularly use access modifiers, such as: public, private, protected and etc. 
However, most useful ones are public/private.

Lets say you have this class with variable:
public class Main {
      int x = 5;    
} 
public class Main2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
           Main m = new Main();
      
            System.out.println(m.x); //fail
    } 
}
Obviously, you can't use 'x' because it is not visible from 'Main' class, that's why it should be public:

public class Main {
   public int x = 5;
}
public class Main2 {
public static void main(String[] args) {
           Main m = new Main();
      
            System.out.println(m.x); //working
    }     
}
Now you can use 'x' anywhere because it is visible. However, you can also make it 'private', so 'x' variable will be hidden.
those access modifiers and keywords can apply to any fields, objects, variables:

public class Main {
     public int x = 5;
     private int  y = 2;
     private MyObject mo = new MyObject(); //class
     public boolean mB = true; 

    public void myMethod() {
    }
    private void myMethod2() {
    }
}
