if-statements in Java is a block of code, it's a stamement to control action flow. Think about planning something, if something
happens then some kind of event will happen. if-stamements can have a 'else' at the end to check if something goes otherwise.
or, if-stamements can be present in methods. and if-statements can be declared inside of if-statements (if done correctly).
if-statements can be used for all kinds of Java programs: Games, Console-based apps/Games, or Desktop apps.
Especially it can be used when you want to check values of variables. Preferences sometimes matter too, different developers
use if-statements in many kinds of ways, including syntaxually. they can declare if staments without bodies or curly-braces.
here is the basic example of if-statements:
public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
               create();
       }
       public static void create() {
	 int x = 5;
		
	if(x < 10) {
	     System.out.println("x is less then 10");
	}else {
	     System.out.println("x is not less then 10");
                    }
             }
}
But as I said, sometimes if stamements can work without needing to use bodies:
public class Main { 
         public static void main(String[] args) {
                        create();
         }
         public static void create() {
	  int x = 5;
		
	if(x < 10) System.out.println("x is less then 10");
	else {
	       System.out.println("x is not less then 10");
	    }
           }
}
And just like that, if statements can be used in all kinds of ways as long as syntaxually and logically it's correct. But otherwise if
it has some syntax/logical errors, errors can happen or uneven result output is expected. You can declare if-statements in
constructors, methods, and even in main method. but static-context/non-static context use in if statements apply too.
