Main method in Java (sometimes called PSVM) is the main entry point of Java programs or Applications, whenever you want to run your Java code, Main method has to be declared inside of class, when meanwhile code should go inside of main method next. 'public' is a access modifier. meaning, main method can be used outside of the Class which contains main method. 'static' is a keyword which specifies that main method becomes part of the other methods. in simple words, JVM won't have to create new and new instances of class where main method is present in order to use it. 'void' means that main method is a type of method that does returns anything, it just specifies that main method is a default method. 'main' is a name for main method, it is not a keyword or something similar to that. String[] args are comming from the Program arguments in your IDE or Development Environment, 'args' array is useful because you can pass Program arguments in it and then use it anywhere in your Java code. When you run your java code by help of PSVM, java launcher is executed that performs native system calls trough LoadLibrary to start Hotspot JVM. There are some ways of how people sometimes declare main method incorrectly, like they may forget to set 'args' to String array or they may try to declare PSVM at the wrong place. how to use main method in a simple way:
public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello"); 
   }
}
That is how you can typically and safely declare main method.
