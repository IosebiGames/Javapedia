Inner Classes in Java (also known as Nested Classes) are kind of classes that can be created inside of class. Think about
Having multiple classes not inside of your project structure or inside of other packages but inside of one class. Unlike
top-level class which by default can't be private, Inner class can be optionally. What makes Inner classes efficient is that you
don't have to manually create new and new classes because you can have multiple classes inside of one class. Of course
there are static Inner classes as well but they are less used but it is still useful. We can access Inner classes int two forms
Locally and anonymously. Here is the basic example of Inner class:
public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main2 m2 = new Main2();
	     
         m2.x = 5;
         System.out.println(m2.x);
        }
        private static class Main2 {
	public int x;
     }
}
What can confuse some people is that this Main2 class is private but we still did manage to create new Instance of this class.
But its important to not forget that Main2 class is private because it can be accessed in a class where its declared but it can't be
accessed in other classes. Or here is how you access Inner classes anonymously:
public class Main {
        private Main(Main2 m2) {
	   System.out.println(m2.init());
         }
         public static void main(String[] args) {
                       new Main(new Main2()); //anonimous
          }
          private static class Main2 {
	  public int x;
		
	  public int init() {
	        return x = 5;
               }
         }
}
This is going to work but obviously there are some people who may think of serializing those Inner classes but problem is that
depending on Java compiler version, you may have trouble with serializing differrent Inner classes. but it is also important to
know that not all inner classes have to be static:
public class Main {
              private Main() {
	   Main2 m2 = new Main2();
	    System.out.println(m2.init());
              }
              public static void main(String[] args) {
                          new Main();
               }
               private class Main2 {
	     public int x;
		
                       public int init() {
                            return x = 5;
             }
       }
}
