Methods in Java are parametrized fields that are able to perform some function if called, they are very important and common in Java and using them is often simple. However, methods have OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Principles such as method overloading and method overriding. But methods by itself can be created inside of class. However, you can't create a method inside of method even if you are able to call one method inside of another method or current method inside of itself. But default methods in Java do not return anything.
simple example to create a method:
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args){
        createMethod();       
   }
   public static void createMethod() {
      System.out.println("Hello");   
   } 
}
in this case, running java code will make it print 'Hello' in a console window. But its important to understand that you can't call non-static method inside of another static method/field. that is why you need to make a method static to call it inside of another static method. However, You can call non-static method inside of static method even without needing to make non-static method, static:
public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args){
          new Main().createMethod();
   }
   public void createMethod() { 
      System.out.println("Hello");   
   }
}
But also we are able to overload the method with parameters to pass arguments later:
public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args){
       new Main().createMethod("Hello");   
    }
    public void createMethod(String text) {
      System.out.println(text);   
   } 
}
But lets work on method overriding itself. to do it, we need to create another class and declare a method there and from the Main class, inherit that another class and then declare method similar to what was declared in another class:
Main class:
public class Main extends Main2 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		createMethod("Hello");
	}
	public static void createMethod(String text) {
		System.out.println(text);
	}
}
Main2 class:
public class Main2 {
	public static void createMethod(String text) {} 
}
