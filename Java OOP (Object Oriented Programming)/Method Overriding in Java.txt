Method Overriding in Java is when you declare method somewhere in class that is 𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐭𝐲. However, you use and fill it from
𝐚𝐧𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 class. Its like leaving empty box inside of one house but filling and preparing it from another class.
in order to Override method, you have to declare a method first in any class, and then inherit class in where method is declared, and
then override it.

it looks like this:
public class Main2 {
     public void calculate(int x, int y);
}
public class Main extends Main2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
    @Override
    public void calculate(int x, int y) {
    }
}

Think of it as a "something declared in another class is not finished and will be used and filled from another class"
