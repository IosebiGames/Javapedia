Overloading method in Java is one of the principles of OOP, it is when you pass 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 in method to use them, but later
when you call that method, you have to insert 𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬.

It is like a promise, You can use something for a method knowing that you will return it later. 
Its like telling Java: "Give me hypothethical working String but later I would give you real one so you can do what I tried"
you can overload as much methods as you want.

overloaded method looks like this:
public void myMethod(int x, int y, MyClass mc, boolean b) {
       System.out.println(x);
       System.out.println(y);
       System.out.println(mc.class.getName());
       System.out.println(b);
}
everytime you pass parameters, you have to specify 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐲𝐩𝐞 before a name or name of the 𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬 that you created instance of.

But when you call that method, as we said you have to pass arguments:
public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
        myMethod(5, 4, mc, true);  

        int x = 5;
        int y = 4;
        MyClass mc = new MyClass();
        boolean b = false;
        myMethod(x, y, mc, b);
   }
   public  static void myMethod(int x, int y, MyClass mc, boolean b) {
        System.out.println(x);
        System.out.println(y);
        System.out.println(mc.class.getName());
        System.out.println(b);
   }
}
Method overloading is very important and useful part of Java.

𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐭: two methods can have a totally same name but still differ because their parameters are different from each other.
