Encapsulation in Java is a popular OOP principle, it is when you want to get value of variable or class despite of it being
declared as 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐞. It is one of the principles that some people hate because they think that too much encapsulation makes
code messy and "verbose".

Encapsulation looks like this:
       public class Main2 {
	private int x;
	private int y;
	private boolean b;
	private Main m;
	public Main2(int x, int y, boolean b, Main m) {
	        this.x = x;
	        this.y = y;
	        this.b = b;
                            this.m = m;
	}
	public int getX() {
	      return x;
	}
	public int getY() {
	      return y;
	}
	public boolean getB() {
	      return b;
	}  
                    public int setX(int x) {
                          this.x = x;
                    }
                    public int setY(int y) {
                          this.y = y;
                    }
                   public boolean setB(boolean b) {
                          this.b = b;
                    }      
     }
    public class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
	  Main2 m2 = new Main2(5, 4, false);
	
	  System.out.println("x: " + m2.getX());
	  System.out.println("y: " + m2.getY());
	  System.out.println("b: " + m2.getB());
          }
}
You can't use 'x' or 'y' or 'b' variable by itself, but you can get it by calling method in another class. But what sets
value for those variables are 𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 from Main2 class constructor. but as you see in Main method, we create new instance of
'Main2' class and then pass arguments in it. and then we can use that instance to get different values using encapsulated methods.
By encapsulation, you can set or get values. and methods that get value are 𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 but methods that set value are 𝐬𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬.
