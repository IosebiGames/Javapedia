Usually when we create variables in Java, we can either make it local variable or Global (Member) variable,
it matters because it can help you to access one variable everywhere in your code. not just locally or at specific lines of code:

lets say you created Two variables:
- x (int): 124
- y (int): 73

Can 'x' use 'y'? No.
Can 'y' use 'x'? Yes.

That's because 'y' is created after 'x' and 'x' is created before 'y'.
So what do we do to make 'y' usable for 'x' and 'x' usable for 'y' ?
That's where Variable scope kicks in:

public class Main {
   public int x = 124;
   public int y = 73;  

    public void init() {
         x = y;
        System.out.println(x); 
   }
   public void doSomething() {
         if(x == 73) {
            //operation
       } 
   }
}
so now you use something beyond at just local lines.
This applies not only to variables but also to Objects and instances:

public class Main {
    public MyObject mo = new MyObject();

    public void myMethod() {
          mo.x = 2; // can be used everywhere
    }
    public void myMethod2() {//even in this method
         mo.y = 3;
   }
}
What can't be done:
public class Main {
    public void myMethod() {
          MyObject mo = new MyObject();
          mo.x = 2; // 'mo' can be used only here.
    }
    public void myMethod2() can't be used in this method
         mo.y = 3; // can't be used
   }
}
That's why its important to know how to distinguish difference between local and global (member) instances and variables.
