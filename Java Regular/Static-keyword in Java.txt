usually in Java we have a keyword of 'static' this means that specific method, class, object instance, variable can be accessed
from anywhere or from another class without needing to create instance of where it is created.
But it is important to understand how usage of 'static' keyword works:

Rules:
- Non-Static Objects/variables/Methods can't be used in static-context.
- Static Objects/variables/Methods can be used in non-static context.
- You don't have to create new instance of class where static Object/variable/method is declared in order to access it.
Example:
public class Main {
        public static int x;
     public static void main(String[] args) {
            x = 5;
    }
}
So since 'x' is static, it can indeed be used static-context. But otherwise if 'x' was not static:
public class Main {
     public int x; 
     public static void main(String[] args){
           x = 5; //it won't work.
    }
}
it won't work because you are trying to use non-static 'x' in static-context. 
But interestingly static Object/method/variable can be used in non-static context as we said:

public class Main {
     public static int x = 5;  
     public static void main(String[] args) { 
     }
     public void print() {
         System.out.println(x);
    }
}
However, 'print' method can't be called in main method because its non-static. 
So you can make it static:
public class Main {
     public static int x = 5;  
     public static void main(String[] args) { 
             print(); // it works now
     }
     public static void print() {
         System.out.println(x);
    }
}
so this time you can call 'print' method without anything.
and the final part is to use static Object/variable/method from another class:

public class Main {
     public static int x = 5;
     public static int y = 2;
     
     public static void printHello() {
          System.out.println("Hello"); 
    }
}
public class Main2 {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
            int x = Main.x;
            int y = Main.y;
            Main.printHello();
            System.out.println(x);
            System.out.println(y);
   }
}
